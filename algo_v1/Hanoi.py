# The puzzle "Tower of Hanoi" consists of three rods and n disks of different sizes.
# It starts with the disks in a stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top,
# and the objective is to move the entire stack to another rod, satisfying the folowing rules.


# - only the uppermost disk on a stack can be moved to the top of another stack at a time
# - no disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk


#Design a recursive algorithm to solve the puzzle and analyze the total number of moves by using recurrence relations
